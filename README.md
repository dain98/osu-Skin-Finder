# osu-Skin-Finder

This is a simple Python script that runs after you run l3lackShark's [gosumemory](https://github.com/l3lackShark/gosumemory). 

**NOTE: THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT WORK ALONE. IT NEEDS TO HAVE GOSUMEMORY RUNNING FIRST.**

Run the .exe in an empty folder. It should generate a skin.txt file and output the skin name into that folder. Use the skin.exe file path in OBS.
